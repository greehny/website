        <h3>I'm greehn, a self-taught programmer, IT student and Pokémon card collector.</h3>
        <h5>I got my start in programming around January 2023
            with the main goal of learning to code minecraft plugins.<br>
            I actively create Spigot plugins, though I am always looking to branch off into different aspects of coding. <br>
            Other coding languages I know include Python, HTML, CSS and Lua (Roblox).<br>
            My <a href="https://github.com/greehny">GitHub</a> contains a list of public projects I have worked on and bothered to upload to the site. Feel free to check it out!
            <br><br>
            As for my IT side, I have a passion, interest and future career in everything server related. I know my stuff when it<br>
            comes to computers and servers and looking to do more with this interest and knowledge. In the near future I plan to setup<br>
            a little server for my plugin projects for myself and others to mess around on and experience them.
            <br><br>
            And as a Pokémon card collector, I am prone to making bad financial decisions. That is all.
