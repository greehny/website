        <h3>I'm greehn, a self-taught programmer, IT student and Pok√©mon card collector.</h3>
        <h4>I got my start in programming around January 2023
            with the main goal of learning to code minecraft plugins.<br>
            I actively create Spigot plugins, though I am always looking to branch off into different aspects of coding. <br>
            My <a href="https://github.com/greehny">GitHub</a> contains a list of public projects I have worked on and bothered to upload to the site. Feel free to check it out!
